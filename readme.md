dl4cvtools is a collection of tools made by me, Antonio Lutfi, for deep learning
in the context of computer vision.

These tools are being made while I go through
the Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python books,
by Dr. Adrian Rosebrock.

Many tools here are not as they are suggested in the books,
and many others are completely independent from its exercises

current submodules are:

-callbacks<br>
-dataloaders<br>
-neural networks<br>
-image preprocessors<br>
-visualisation tools<br>
-models<br>
